Problem: Suggestion List Truncator

You are building a feature that shows travel suggestions, but you only want to show the top 3 rated suggestions. You are given a list of suggestions and their ratings.

Input Specification:
The first line is an integer N (1 <= N <= 100), the number of suggestions.
The next N lines each contain a floating-point rating followed by a comma and the suggestion name (a string).

Output Specification:
Print the names of the top 3 suggestions, sorted from highest to lowest rating. If there are fewer than 3 suggestions, print all of them. If there is a tie in rating, the one that appeared earlier in the input should be listed first.

Sample Input:

9.8,Visit the pyramids
8.5,Hike the Inca Trail
9.5,Go on a safari
9.8,See the Northern Lights
8.9,Explore Rome

Sample Output:
