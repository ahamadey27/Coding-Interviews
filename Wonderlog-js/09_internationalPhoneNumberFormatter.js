Format raw phone numbers into a standard international format. The rule is to take the last 9 digits of the number and format them as `+XX XXX-XXX-XXX`, where `+XX` is a given country code.

Input Specification:
The first line is a country code (e.g., `+44`).
The second line is an integer N (1 <= N <= 20), the number of phone numbers.
The next N lines each contain a raw phone number string.

Output Specification:
For each raw number, print the newly formatted phone number on a new line.

Sample Input:
+1
4
5551234567
18005551234
987654321

Sample Output:
+1 555-123-4567
+1 800-555-1234
+1 987-654-321
